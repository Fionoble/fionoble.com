I'm a Shopify employee, and like any good company, it's strong encouraged to use the platform we build ([dogfooding](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30784/dogfooding#:~:text=The%20term%20%22dogfooding%22%20is%20an,bugs%2C%20as%20in%20beta%20testing.)) and empathize with the users of our platform (become a merchant). So I decided to create one. 

I started one earlier during the first year or so at Shopify but didn't get too far with it. I was utilizing a [print on demand](https://www.shopify.ca/blog/print-on-demand) service called [Printify](https://printify.com/). I was selling t-shirts and some other apparel with icons on them. Simple idea but it was really cool! I got a bunch of samples from and they are still part of my regular wardrobe! (The shirt my avatar on the home page is wearing is also one of those shirts!) In the many months I had the store running, I made one legit sale and it was to my brother üòÖ. After spending a bit of money on Ads, with no results, I decided to shut it down for a bit and just focus on my day job.

The intention was to always start it back up when I had a little more mental space and energy. I recently realized that criteria would never be met üôÉ So I changed my thinking to "No better time than now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è". 

I spent the last couple of weeks putting together my store but was struggling to think of what to sell. I then took inspiration from some of my co-workers and decided to sell some digital art. It's a little more involved but it's a bit more of a motivator for me to finish the art projects I start instead of bailing part way through. I currently only have 2 pieces that could be considered complete so I just opened my store with those two. 

Seeing such an empty store bugs me to I'm hoping to use that as motivation to create more and throw it up there. 

## A little more on how I set up the store

Thankfully I had some of the work already done since my first attempt at running a store. So things like setting up the domain, pages and navigation was already taken care of. 

What I needed to figure out is how to distribute my prints, what my storefront should look like and the content of site.

For the storefront, theres a free theme called Studio which seemed catered towards more creative sellers so I went with that and customized it in the editor. I would love to tinker around with Shopify's custom storefront API and libraries ([hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/)) but in due time. I want to get something out there first and then I'll work on improving it after.

I more or less added the content of the pages as I was customizing it. So that was a bit of a 2 in 1 approach.

For the distribution I decided to go with something that had little up front overhead so I went with another print on demand service. This one is called [Printful](https://www.printful.com/) and has "Framed posters" as an option for merch. If demand on my work ever picks up I'll consider something with a bit more initial overhead but one that scales/provides a larger benefit (I mean profit really).

I know there's the concept of [NFTs](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/digital-service-product/nfts) and maybe it would be worth looking into, but really only if business picks up.

So there it is. I (re)launched [my Shopify store](https://fionoble.shop)! Let's see if I can follow through on creating more supply and see how business goes! 

This is definitely on way to curb my need to do 3,897,123 hobbies. This will hopefully help me hone in on a few skills and improve them üôÇ
