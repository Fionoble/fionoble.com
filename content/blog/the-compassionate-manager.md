title: 'The Compassionate Manager'

Why I'm writing this?
- Switching to IC track and want to decribe where I've come to as a manager. There aren't a lot of managers that share this style.

What makes a compassionate manager

Empathy
- 
Trust
- Trust your people (or build that trust)
Confidence
- Confidence in your team primarily, but also the technology
Observant
- Highlevel, unacctionable feedback is useless
Be Technical
- That's why I'm going back to the IC track
Passionate about the work
- If you aren't excited about this, find something new. 


Don't be a manager to just coast or grow your career. There are places that have a great IC track so management is NTO your only option.
