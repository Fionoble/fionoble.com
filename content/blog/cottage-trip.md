title: 'First family cottage trip'

Last week my family and I took a week and went North to a cottage we rented. Well, more of a cottage resort. We started the trip off with the kids asking to go home, and left with the kids asking to stay longer. Pretty sure that counts as a successful trip!

It was a wonderful time, definitely some ups and downs and some things we would've done a little differently but for the first one I think it went incredibly well. So much so that we intend to make this an annual tradition. Take a week(ish) off in the summer and rent a cottage. Maybe someday we'll end up buying our own but for now, we'll stick to renting!

There were many firsts! The kids had Jello for the first time, had roasted marshmallows for the first time, we also went to Santa's village and the kids had a great time going on some small rides (still too nervous for the big ones).

### Santa's village

We started that event off with a couple of fairly nervous children who weren't willing to try any rides. They wanted to see things and that was it. Until we found a little tractor ride that went about 2.5 km/h. That was the one. It was a simple tractor that went around a short track and was done in all of 90 seconds. The kids loved it. This was exactly what they needed to start feeling comfortable. We ended up going on that same ride about 5 more times. 

After the first few times the kids really started opening up to the park and wanting to explore a little more. We found a playground with some slides and then convinced the kids to go on the train that goes around the whole park. The kids really enjoyed that. We also went on a couple of merry-go-rounds.

We took a break in the middle there and went to go get ice cream. When we asked for 2 kiddie scoops we got two tubs of ice cream... When I asked for a single scoop I received a vat of ice cream... soooo much ice cream! However, no one was really complaining, except for my wife (L) who was mostly cold on that cloudy day.

### Kayaking

Another thing that was a first for all of us except for L. The first time we went we tried to take the whole family. 2 adults and 2 kids in a tandem kayak. We somehow managed to figure it out but Jet got super nervous and pretty much wailed the entire time we were on the water so that trip didn't last very long.

I tried to go myself later to actually try it out and the water made me CRAZY nervous. I didn't feel any of that when I was out with the kids. My theory is that I was focused on making sure the kids enjoyed it. But now that I was out on my own... I was seeing the water and feeling all the anxiety (which I'm sure Jet was also feeling). That was the first attempt and I didn't end up going too far. 

The second try was much better but I pretty much hugged the shore the whole time. I made sure not to get more than about 30 feet away from it, but it was progress! I was still very anxious about being on the water by myself, even though I was wearing a life jacket.

A couple of days later I tried again. This time was VASTLY different than the first two. I went out fairly far and went for a fairly long time. I often second guessed and would turn around to go back and then again change my mind and try to go further. I probably looked pretty silly in retrospect going in circles on the water. However, I ended up pushing my comfort further and further until at one point I was pretty far out in the lake and was actually enjoying it. Even when stronger waves came by I thought it was more fun than scary. 

I really felt like I had overcome something big and I realised that I really like kayaking! This will definitely be one of the most memorable moments of the trip for me.

### First of many

Like I mentioned, we enjoyed the trip so much that we decided to make this a tradition (with some adjustments in the planning and logistics). The fact that the kids had such a great time as well made it an extra plus. One thing we may try next time is coming with another family (or two). That and we'd also likely upgrade our cabin since it was super tiny and the toilet felt like it was going to fall through the floor...
