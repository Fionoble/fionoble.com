# It took a minute but it finally got me. 

I'm lucky that it was the later more milder variant that we ended up getting but it still wasn't very pleasant. I had a pretty high fever and a lot of aches. My 3 year old got it the worst though and that was tough to go through. She's pretty tough and is getting past the tail end of it but man... it already hurts to watch your kiddos get sick, and this was no exception. Even my older boy was saying that he was feeling sad that his sister wasn't feeling well. 

Anyway, my son somehow managed to not have any symptoms and tested negative the entire time. What a little champion. 

It was my birthday this past weekend and I spent it looking after my sick family, which was, in a weird way, a gift in and of itself. It was one of perspective and where I came from. This is what I wanted from my life. To have a family that I'm able to provide for and look after and this is where I am sitting. Toughing out COVID and then looking after my wife and kiddos.

However, I did get a pretty cool wood burning kit and a speed cube from my wife and kiddos so that's also some great gifts! 

As a complete aside. I wrote this post in a very journal-like manner and I enjoyed it. I don't expect people to really be reading a lot of my posts but if you enjoy it then I figured I would explain why it's kinda all over the place.
