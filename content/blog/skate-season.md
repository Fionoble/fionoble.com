"Skate season is upon us!" he said while a mix of rain and snow came down outside his house...

Yesterday, the temperature was about 13 degress celcius and it was gorgeous. It was incredibly wet outside since the 2 feet piles of snow everywhere was rapidly melting but I had took to opportunity to clean out the garage and organize things. Some of the items I sorted were my skate rail and skate box.

This got me super hyped for (more consistent)nicer weather so I can hop ack on my board and learn new tricks! I actually ended up throwing downa couple of tricks in the garage, but then got super tired ðŸ˜…

I actually took a video of a bunch of the tricks I had by the end of the season last year! [Here's it is!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yZDVWOS5rB8LxQ17-lLFoPHBkNK_JInW/view?usp=sharing)

I also discovered a new skatepark near my house. It's tiny but that's kinda why I like it! Some videos of that spot coming soon. 

I'll throw together a list of tricks I have and want to learn just to share (and for me to keep track of, I'm the only one on this blog anyway ðŸ™ƒ
