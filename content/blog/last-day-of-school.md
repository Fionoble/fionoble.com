It was my son's last day of school a few weeks ago. He was just finishing up senior kindergarten. His school definitely has party school vibes. There was a big graduation ceremony for him and end of school celebration (I still can't believe he's going into Grade 1 in September... where did my little boy go? üò≠).

On his last day of school, after we had finished dinner and play and we were getting ready for bed, he got really sad. Usually this is annoying and routine since he wants to play all day and is severely allergic to sleep. This time it was different though... he was very sad.. and started crying. Genuine crying, not that cry to get out of doing something cry. This was a real cry.

He was sad that school was done. He was going to miss school, miss his friends but mostly miss his teacher. We did our best to console him. Remembering that we don't want to dismiss these feelings. Reminding him that he'll go back after summer or that summer would be better, wouldn't be helpful. Although, that didn't stop us from mentioning these things to him. We just didn't emphasize or put too much weight on it.

It was tough to see how upset he was. However, it was also really cute and really encouraging. It's awesome to see how he loves learning, and loves school. I'm going to appreciate this until it stops and school stops being as fun üòÖ It was really encouraging because for the first time ever, Jet was having big feelings that he understood. He was able to pinpoint why he was so upset and he was able to communicate it to us. It was quite the feeling.

Hey parents, this shit is hard... but as hard as it is, the milestones and wins are incredible. Don't give up! ‚ù§Ô∏è
